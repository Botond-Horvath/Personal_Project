            Binary Stars: A Hope for Mass!
        </h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p style="margin-top:60px;">
                So, we have come to face the terrible truth that calculating the mass
                of a star sitting alone in the vacuum of space is physically impossible.
                However, there is hope. We know that mass can be derived from observing
                the effect of gravity between two objects. There are laws in fact,
                starting from Kepler all the way to Newton that explain the rules by
                which celestial bodies, like planets or stars behave when they are under
                each other's influence. Now, not all stars are like 51 Pegasi or our
                Sun, meaning that they are alone. There are many stars, in fact about
                half of all known stars, that have a companion, in a distance from them
                where they are under each other’s gravitational effect so much so that
                they orbit each other. These stars are called <b>Binary Stars</b>.
                They can be observed visually by a telescope, if the binary star is
                close enough to Earth (like the Alpha Centauri system), or if the two
                stars are far enough from each other. Binary stars that are visible
                therefore are called <b>visual binaries</b>. However, for most binaries,
                this is not the case, and the binary star looks as though it was one
                star, since the components are too far away, and the two stars are appear
                too close for any human or instrument to be able to visibly see or image
                the two, three, or sometimes even four stars in a stellar system. For
                these situations however, astronomers can use the same methods that they
                use to detect exoplanets: the radial velocity, and transit methods!
            </p>
            <p>
                For our purposes, we are very interested in getting to know the masses
                of the stars, and therefore we are interested in the radial velocity
                method (more information in the <a href="observations.html">methods
                section</a>). Binary stars that were discovered or can be observed
                with the use of this method are known as <b>spectroscopic binaries</b>.
                To make collecting data simpler, binary stars are usually similar in
                mass to each other (unlike a star and an exoplanet), and therefore it
                is not a tiny wobble in the parent star that is being detected, like
                with exoplanets, but instead the system of two stars (usually similar
                in mass) orbiting each other. This means that it is common for
                astronomers to come across so-called <b>double lined</b> spectroscopic
                binaries, where when the spectrum of the “star” is taken, there seems
                to be two absorption lines for each absorption line. This indicates that
                there are two stars present, each of which is giving off its own version
                of the absorption lines, and each of which is doppler shifted in opposite
                directions, so that the pair of lines would be visible on the same
                spectrum (at different wavelengths). Below is a visual representation of
                this effect on the spectrum (<i>figure 7</i>). If the absorption lines
                of two stars with equal radial velocities were to be observed, then the
                two lines would not be visible, since the doppler (red or blue) shift of
                the two stars would be equal.

                Figure 7: Comparison of a single (top) and double (bottom) lined
                spectrum for <i>&kappa; Arietis</i>

        </figure>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Kappa Arietis is the name of the double lined spectroscopic binary
                whose spectrum is displayed on <i>figure 7</i>. It might be difficult
                to see on the outer emission spectra, but the inner absorption spectra
                show clearly that the top spectrum was taken at a time when the two
                stars were of equal radial velocity, probably when neither of them had
                any radial velocity from our vantage point, meaning that they were
                aligned from our line of site, while the bottom shows clearly that each
                absorption line is doubled. This measurement on the other hand was
                probably taken at a time when the radial velocities of the two components
                in this star system were heading in opposite directions, meaning that
                one of them was redshifted and the other blueshifted from our perspective,
                causing the spectra of the two components to separate.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this way, astronomers pick out one very prominent absorption line
                (usually Hydrogen alpha), and then looking at a lot of spectra
                measurements taken at different times, calculate the radial velocity
                of both components of that line, at those different times. As already
                mentioned, the radial velocity can be calculated from wavelength by the
                following equation:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="rVelocityCalc.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Where <i>v</i> is the radial velocity, <i>c</i> is the speed of light in
                a vacuum, while the greek letter <i>lambda</i> denotes the wavelength
                of the spectral line. <i>Delta lambda</i> is the change between the
                wavelengths of the measured spectral line, and the same spectral line
                measured in a laboratory (calculating the doppler shift), while
                <i>&lambda;<sub>0</sub></i> denotes the laboratory wavelength also.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in this way, radial velocity measurements are taken for one
                absorption line over many different measurements taken at different
                phases of the orbit. Such raw data then, as the next step of the
                observations, can be graphed. For our example, let's take the binary
                star <i>Beta Orionis B</i>. Beta Orionis is the official name for
                <b>Rigel</b>, a star found on the bottom right of the Orion
                constellation, seen in the northern night sky in the winter months
                (<i>figure 8</i>). Rigel in fact is itself a quadruple star system,
                meaning that it is made up of components Rigel A, Ba, Bb, and C. As
                seen, Rigel Ba and Bb form a binary system, while this binary star Rigel
                B itself forms a binary with Rigel C, both of which also form a binary
                with Rigel A. So this is a very exciting system, in which Rigel A is a
                blue supergiant, while the other components are B type main sequence
                stars (so very hot)!

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="text">s
            <p>
                Rigel A and BC form a visual binary, separated by an orbital period
                of tens of thousands of years! That being said, B and C are still
                separated by a huge distance, with an orbital period of 63 years, and
                also form a visual binary. So really Ba and Bb, the two components of
                Rigel B are the only components discovered as a binary
                spectroscopically. They form a double lined spectroscopic binary.
                Wanting to see what would happen if the radial velocity raw data for
                this binary system were graphed against time, raw data was taken
                from a 1942 article by <i>Roscoe Sanford</i> on the system, and then
                graphed against time using Python Matplotlib techniques
                (<i>figure 9</i>).

            <p>
                As seen (<i>figure 9</i>), when the double lined spectrum phenomenon
                is presented graphically, the results are striking. The radial velocity
                curve now has two components, both of which are sinusoidal, but appear
                to be reflected on a horizontal axis. This horizontal axis is not at 0,
                representing that the two star components together already had a radial
                velocity, along with all of Rigel, through the galaxy. This value is
                constant. However, as seen, component A and B of the system can be
                distinguished, and since they orbit each other, when one of them is
                moving away from our vantage point, the other is moving towards us, and
                vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the first step is completed. We have established that Rigel B forms a
                spectroscopic binary, and have cleaned the data in graphical form. From
                this, a lot of information can be determined that can help towards
                deriving the masses of the components. All of this information is
                derived from the graph. The axis on which the two sine curves meet is
                the shared radial velocity of the whole system through the galaxy (needs
                to be taken as the zero value), the period is the time that it takes for
                one wave cycle to be completed, and the velocities are the semi
                amplitudes of the two waves. Here is the data, all taken directly from
                the above graph:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass1.jpg"/>
            <p>
                In other words, the center of mass of Rigel B is moving towards us at
                <i>19.1 km/s</i>, Rigel Ba and Bb take <i>9.86 days</i> to complete one
                orbit around each other, and in this orbit, the velocity of the larger
                component Ba is <i>25.0 km/s</i>, while for the smaller component it’s
                <i>32.6 km/s</i>. The fact that the larger component has a smaller
                velocity makes sense, since its orbit would be smaller, due to less
                displacement in the orbit as opposed to the less massive component.
                Also, it makes sense that we take the semi amplitudes (maximum radial
                velocities) of the components as their true velocity in orbit, since
                this maximum radial velocity is achieved when the components are moving
                exactly away or towards us in their orbit (at the halfway point). This
                would mean that their tangential velocity would be equal to their radial
                velocity, and therefore their true velocity in an ideal orbit (<i>figure
                10</i>).

                These values are also underpinned by the graphs acquired from the

                These values, that have now all been observationally measured, can be
                used as the basis of derivations for the mass. This in reality is all
                that needs to be known observationally, the rest can be calculated using
                physical laws. First however, it is important to be visually able to
                understand the important parameters of a binary star orbit, like that of
                Rigel B visually (<i>figure 12</i>).

                First of all, it is evident that the velocity of Ba in <i>km/day</i> for
                example would be equal to the circumference of the orbit (distance in
                <i>km</i>) over the period of the orbit (in <i>days</i>). This can be
                rearranged to solve for the radius of the orbit for both stars (distance
                from the center of mass). Adding these two values will yield the total
                distance between the stars:

                The same calculation can be applied to the less massive component,
                however, knowing that the ratio of the velocities is equal to the ratio
                of the distances and also the masses, we can apply that:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass3.jpg"/>
            <p>Knowing this, the total separation of the two stars can be calculated:</p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass4.jpg"/>
            <p>
                So now we know that the total distance between the components Ba and Bb
                of Rigel B is about <b>0.0533 astronomical units</b> (one AU is the
                distance from the Earth to the Sun). So they are very close to each
                other, and no wonder they could be only observed spectroscopically.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we are really close to calculating the masses of these two
                components, knowing their separation and period. In fact, we know that
                the semi-major axis, or separation, is directly related to the period of
                any orbit from Kepler’s 3rd law:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass5.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Or in other words, the period of the orbit squared is proportional to the
                semi major axis, or radius of the orbit on the third power. Newton was
                able to apply his laws, in particular the laws of gravitation and
                centrifugal force, to come up with his own version of this law, that can
                be applied to a binary star orbit, since it also involves the mass
                parameter of both stars. First of all, Newton’s universal law of
                gravitation calculated the force of gravity (in <i>Newtons</i>) between
                two celestial objects, or in our case the two binary stars of Rigel B (Ba
                and Bb). According to Newton, we can model this gravitational force as:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass6.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Untangling the law only a bit allows us to understand the fundamental
                way that gravitation behaves. We can see first of all that the force of
                gravity decreases by a constant value while the distance increases by a
                factor. This means that if the two binary stars were twice as far from
                each other, then the gravitational force between them would be 2x2 or 4
                times less. This is why we divide by the radius of the orbit squared.
                Furthermore, the force of gravity depends on the masses of the two
                stars, as seen, or to be exact, the product of their masses. So the
                more massive any one of the stars becomes, the more gravitational force
                will be present. G represents the gravitational constant, and this is
                meant to act, like all constants, as a conversion factor between the
                calculated force (<i>kg/m<sup>2</sup></i>) into newtons
                ((kg*m)/s<sup>2</sup>). This constant was derived theoretically by
                Newton, but also calculated experimentally much later by Cavendish.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second aspect that we need to model is the centrifugal force of the
                orbit for one of the stars. We can choose component Ba for this. We know
                that since the gravitational force between the two stars Ba and Bb is
                constant, or the same for both, the centrifugal force also needs to be
                equal for both stars. This is due to the fact that the centrifugal
                (outward force due to the rotation) and centripetal (gravitational)
                forces in an orbit need to be equal, so that the orbiting stars do not
                escape from the orbit (if the centrifugal force was stronger), and also
                do not collide (if the gravitational force were to be stronger). So, the
                centrifugal force of the orbit, calculated with Ba, can be modelled as
                follows:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass7.jpg"/>
            <p>
                This makes sense again, since we can understand that the centrifugal
                force therefore in Newtons depends on three parameters. The mass, the
                velocity, and the orbital radius. As seen, the greater the mass, the
                greater this force will be. Similarly, the greater the orbital radius,
                the less the force will be. The velocity is related to the centrifugal
                force squared, meaning that if the star were twice as fast in its orbit,
                the centrifugal force would act on it <i>2x2=4</i> times as strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that we know all of these parameters that are required for these
                equations, except for the mass. Like so, Newton was able to isolate the
                mass parameter, which will be useful to us, by knowing that the force of
                gravity is equal to the centrifugal force:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass8.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Now the problem arises that we have two different orbital radii. One of
                them, <i>r<sub>1</sub></i> denotes the orbital radius of Ba, while
                <i>r</i> denotes the separation of the two stars. However, we can
                substitute our the <i>r<sub>1</sub></i>> parameter applying the basic
                relationships of the orbital parameters of this binary star, or any
                other orbit:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass9.jpg"/>
            <p>
                This makes sense because the smaller the orbital radius of the star, the
                larger its mass has to be to conserve the same centrifugal force, based
                on what was discussed. Continuing:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass10.jpg"/>
            <p>
                So we can replace the orbital radius of Ba with this new rearrangement,
                that only contains that total separation (<i>r</i>):
            </p>
            <img style="width:20%" class="equasion" src="mass11.jpg"/>
            <p>
                So now Newton was able to rearrange his findings as we have done above,
                to come up with this new formula that stems from Kepler's 3rd law, where
                he noted that the orbital radius and the period are proportional, and
                takes it further by finding the exact law. As seen, this new law or
                version of Kepler’s law involves the total mass of the star system also,
                and this is very important for our purposes, since we can rearrange it as:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass12.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Since we know all of the parameters: the semi-major axis or total
                separation of the two stars, as well as the period of the orbit, we are
                set to calculate the total masses of the two stars. Using the above
                equation involves the standard SI units, so seconds for the period,
                meters for the separation, and therefore will yield the total mass in
                kilograms. However, taking out all of the constants yields an equation
                that can be used with relative units, and therefore calculate the mass
                in solar masses, and use the period in years (relative to Earth) and the
                separation in AU (also relative to Earth):
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass13.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Knowing that the separation of Rigel Ba and Bb is <i>0.0522AU</i> or about
                <i>7.81x10<sup>9</sup>m</i>, and that the period is <i>9.86</i> days
                which is equivalent to 0.027 years or 851,904 seconds, we can use both
                formulas to solve for the total mass of the system:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass14.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Using the other equation with the SI units:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass15.jpg"/>
            <p>
                As seen, in both instances, we get the result that the total mass of the
                binary star Rigel B, or the mass of components Ba and Bb added is about
                one fifth of the mass of the Sun (<b>0.2M&#9737;</b>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Now wait a second! This seems extremely irrelevant based on what we know
                about stars. How can two B class super hot blue main sequence stars
                together be only one fifth the mass of the Sun itself, which is a G class
                moderate yellow star? If we were to take the individual masses of the
                two components, they would be even smaller. Knowing that the ratio of
                the masses is equal to the ratio of the distances:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass16.jpg"/>
            <p>
                So as seen even clearer, we are getting results that suggest that two
                B-type main sequence stars, that are many times more luminous and hotter
                and even larger than the Sun as suggested by the HR diagram have masses
                that are around 1/10 that of the Sun, which is only an average G-type
                star! This seems totally wrong. However, there is one aspect that was
                not taken into account during this calculation process. That is called
                the <b><i>sin(i)</i> degeneracy</b>, which means that the masses that
                are calculated from an orbit can only be considered the <b>minimum
                masses</b> of those stars. The <b>true mass</b> will only equal or be
                close to the minimum mass if the inclination of the orbit of the binary
                system relative to Earth is close to 90 degrees, meaning that it is
                parallel to the line of sight, and perpendicular to the plane of the sky.
                The more the orbit is inclined, radial velocity measurements will
                become smaller and smaller, skewing the results for mass, and only
                providing a minimal mass (<i>figure 13</i>).

            <p>
                So as can be seen, the radial velocity as perceived by observers here on
                Earth can be greatly altered by the orbital inclination of an orbit.
                What we can theorize with regards to Rigel B is that the inclination of
                its orbit must be very high, since the radial velocity measurements also
                must be much lower than their real value due to the fact that the
                masses are much lower than their probable estimated value.
            </p>
            <p>
                So in fact, yet again another obstacle. Theoretically, if the inclination
                angle could be measured, the true masses of the stars could be
                calculated, since the general relation is that:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="sine.jpg"/>
            <p>
                However, there is no way in current knowledge to be able to calculate
                the inclination angle of an orbit. If there was a way to estimate true
                mass, from a parameter like luminosity for example, based on the
                estimated true mass and the measured minimum mass, the inclination angle
                could also be estimated. However, a relation to estimate the true mass
                cannot be found until the true masses of at least a dataset worth of
                stars can be calculated precisely, so that their masses could be compared
                to look for a relation. So astronomers seemed to be stuck by this
                degeneracy for a long time. However, theoretical derivations brought
                hope.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, a possible solution was to look for binary stars that have not only
                been detected spectroscopically, but also through the transit method,
                since we know that the inclination of an orbit where a binary star was
                observed to transit in front of its companion would have to be very
                close to 90 degrees. Otherwise, the transit would not be observed.
                I found the perfect star for this, so called AB Andromedae, in the
                constellation Andromeda. It was first observed with the transit method
                (<i>figure 14</i>), which provides the first clue that its orbital
                inclination would have to be in a reliable enough range that any mass we
                would calculate through the radial velocity method would also be reliable.

                After this, I was able to find radial velocity data on this same star

                Graphing the raw data of 70 entries for the double lined radial velocity
                data using Matplotlib, just like with the Rigel B binary, I was able to

                time. However, conveniently, a similar graph was included with the

                It is interesting to see on both graphs that no data points were
                measured close to the base RV axis, or dashed lines of the system. This
                is probably due to the fact that data points could only be collected
                once the spectral lines of the double lined spectroscopic binary
                separated. Where there are no points on the spectrum, the lines were
                merged due to the low RV shift.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, just like with Rigel B, again, we can infer all of the parameters
                needed and then use the extension of Kepler’s law to calculate their mass:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass17.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Knowing both the period and the semi major axis, the total mass, and
                therefore the individual masses of A Andromedae and B Andromedae can be
                calculated:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass18.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Finally, from the ratio of the two masses and the total mass, the mass of
                each component is derived:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mass19.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Now these numbers seem much more reliable, and since from other
                analysis, like the one we did with 51 Pegasi in previous sections, we
                know that the components of this binary star are G-type and very close
                in temperature to the Sun. The extremely short distance and period seems
                to suggest that this binary star might even be a <b>contact binary</b>,
                meaning that the two components actually touch each other (this star is
                listed as a contact binary in catalogs). Regardless of this however, the
                numbers are reliable, and this is evidently due to the fact that the
                orbital inclination must be very low to permit transit observations also
                to be made with this star.
            </p>
            <p>
                So finally, more or less reliable measurements can be made on the masses
                of some binary stars with low orbital inclinations. For these stars, we
                can also make the same observations based on their temperature,
                luminosity, spectral type, radius, and many others previously discussed.
                The only hope for ever finding a way to measure the masses of single
                stars is to find, therefore, some sort of relationship between the mass
                and another parameter of a star. Starting with the luminosity, I graphed
                the masses vs. the luminosities of 10,000 different binary stars where
                there was data for these parameters (<i>figure 17</i>). The results
                finally provide the answer to how we can estimate the mass of 51 Pegasi.

                As seen, through an experimental approach, astronomers finally found
                that the luminosity and mass of all stars that are the main sequence (for
                giants it is more complicated) is closely related. In fact, as seen from
                the logarithmic scales on the graph, the relation can be written as

                relationship is more reliable as:

            <p>
                This is revolutionary, since there is finally a way for the mass of any
                single star to be estimated from a well known parameter, such as
                luminosity. Also, this provides a way to estimate the true mass of any
                binary system, which after measuring the minimum mass allows the
                calculation of the inclination angle for the orbit. This has been done
                for many stars now, and there are catalogues that now exist for orbital
                inclinations of many binaries also.

                For the sake of 51 Pegasi, applying the relation yields a mass estimate
                of about <b>1.1 solar masses</b>!
