                <b>Apparent Magnitude</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The apparent magnitude, after the parallax angle, is the second
                parameter that needs to actually be measured for stars. It is a measure
                of the brightness of the star, or the magnitude of the star, as
                perceived from Earth. Telescope instruments can measure this, often in
                the form of <b>flux</b> (<i>watts/&#13217;</i>). This then can be
                converted to the magnitude scale, and denoted as apparent magnitude.
            </p>
            <p>
                The magnitude scale is a scale of star brightness that was first
                developed by the ancient Greeks, where 1 was defined as a category for
                the brightest stars, and 6 as the category for the dimmest ones. So,
                the way that the magnitude scale works is that the higher the number,
                the dimmer the star. The Greeks used Sirius, the brightest star in the
                night sky as the default value, with magnitude 1. Since then, the scale
                has been expanded to include even brighter objects as negative values
                (Sirius at -1.46), and dim objects way past 6 (Hubble deep space images
                down to +30 magnitude). A jump of one magnitude value corresponds to a
                change in brightness (or flux) by a factor of about 2.512, or the 5th
                root of 100. A magnitude 2 star therefore is approximately 16x brighter
                than a magnitude 5 star:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="mApparent.jpg"/>
            <p>
                So understanding this, after a telescope instrument measured the flux
                of 51 Pegasi, that flux was compared to the flux of a star whose
                brightness was already known, such as Vega yielding the relative
                brightness to that star, and then from there the relative magnitude to
                that star could also be calculated in the above way but reversed (for
                the case of Vega, the magnitude is 0 so the calculation is fairly
                simple). In this way, the apparent magnitude of 51 Pegasi was found to
                be <b>5.49</b> through a visible filter. This means that it is about 150x
                dimmer than the star Vega, and 600x dimmer than Sirius, the brightest
                star. In perfect conditions, it is just barely visible, since the limit
                for a perfect human eye in perfect conditions tends to be 6th magnitude.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that this parameter is not called magnitude, but apparent
                magnitude. This is due to the fact that this measured magnitude is not
                the real magnitude or brightness of the star (also known absolute
                magnitude), but rather just the magnitude as perceived from the observer,
                here on Earth. This means that if we have two stars, star A could be
                1000x more luminous in absolute magnitude than star B, but star Bâ€™s
                apparent magnitude could still be greater, if it is closer. Therefore,
                for the sake of further calculations, the absolute magnitude is of more
                value.
            </p>
            <p>
                The absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude of a star as
                it would seem observed from a distance of 10 parsecs. Therefore, knowing
                the distance and the apparent magnitude now, we can calculate that, and
                from there, the relative luminosity.
            </p>
            <p><b>Absolute Magnitude</b></p>
            <p>
                We now know two things about 51 Pegasi. That its distance is
                15.4 parsecs, and that its apparent magnitude is 5.49. To calculate the
                absolute magnitude from this, we know that this magnitude would have to
                be the perceived apparent magnitude from 10 parsecs. We can think of an
                imaginary version of 51 Pegasi at a distance of 10 parsecs, the apparent
                brightness of which would be equal to the absolute brightness. For this
                conversion, we first need to calculate how much farther our real star is
                from the imaginary star. We can think of this as:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="distanceEquasion.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Knowing how much farther 51 Pegasi is from our imaginary star at 10
                parsecs, we can calculate how much dimmer it appears than our imaginary
                version at 10 parsecs, where the apparent and absolute magnitudes would
                be equal. For this, we need to understand the basic relationship between
                change in distance and change in brightness. Since brightness needs to
                scatter in a spherical manner from a star, and the distance can be
                thought of as the radius of this sphere, the surface area that the light
                needs to fill is not the distance, but:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="surface.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Therefore, the change in distance is related to the change in brightness
                in the following way:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="distanceChanges.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Therefore, due to the nature of this relation, knowing how much father
                our star is from its imaginary version, we can find how much dimmer it
                is than it would be by the following relation:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="conversion1.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Instead of thinking of this value as how much dimmer 51 Pegasi appears
                than its imaginary version, we can also think of this as how much
                brighter the absolute brightness would be compared to the apparent
                brightness, since absolute brightness (magnitude) is defined as the
                apparent brightness at 10 parsecs, or where our imaginary star is located.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we are left with the task of converting how much brighter the
                absolute brightness is compared to the apparent brightness, to
                magnitudes. We know from the definition of magnitudes that the we can
                calculate the relative brightness of a star compared to another in the
                following way:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="conversion2.jpg"/>
            <p>
                We can think of the magnitude of our imaginary star as equal to the
                absolute magnitude, since it is located at 10 parsecs, and therefore this
                relation can be rewritten as:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="conversion3.jpg"/>
            <p>
                In other words, we have established that the 5th root of 100 (change in
                1 level of magnitude) raised to the change in magnitudes between the
                absolute and the apparent magnitudes is equal to the relative brightness
                of our imaginary star at 10 parsecs to that of our actual star. It makes
                sense to subtract the absolute magnitude from the apparent magnitude,
                since if the star is farther than 10 parsecs (almost always), then the
                apparent magnitude will be dimmer than the absolute magnitude. Dimmer
                however means larger on the magnitude scale, so the relative brightness
                will still increase.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only task now that we have to face is rearranging this equation that
                has been established so that the absolute magnitude would be isolated,
                allowing us to solve for it knowing now the apparent magnitude and
                distance:
            </p>
            <img class="equasion" src="conversion4.jpg"/>
            <p>
                Now that we have constructed a formula, knowing the distance and apparent
                magnitudes, the absolute magnitude of 51 Pegasi can be calculated as about
                <b>4.5</b>:
